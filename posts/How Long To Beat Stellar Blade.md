As cited in our Stellar Blade review, we completed the campaign in around 31 hours. However, this also includes tackling several side quests.


## Main story only

For those who want to focus on the main story, you can expect to finish Stellar Blade in roughly 20 hours. If you want to speed things up, you can also enable Story Mode and Action Assist. The former weakens enemies significantly, while the latter triggers quick-time events (QTE), with button prompts to help you avoid attacks.

## Completionist playthrough

Completionists, however, can expect anywhere from 40 to 60 hours due to several factors. We don't want to delve further into spoilers, but we're going to mention some tidbits:


- Stellar Blade has hundreds of collectibles and items that you can gather over the course of your playthrough. These include Eve outfits, Adam/Lily outfits, Exospines, soda/beer cans, and more.

- Apart from the main missions, there are side quests from NPCs, bulletin board assignments, and even a fishing minigame arc. Some of these unlock new locations, such as the Eidos 7 Flooded Commercial Plaza and Wasteland Forbidden Area.

- There are points no return in the game and secrets.
- Lastly, there are three endings.

Because of these factors, a single playthrough will not be enough. You must clear New Game Plus to unlock everything in the game.
